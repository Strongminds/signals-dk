*about this document*
SIA, Signalen Informatievoorziening Amstermdam, is, as the name implies, a
project of the municipality of Amsterdam. Its goal is to facilitate the process
of maintaining public space by registering complaints or notifications about the
Amsterdam public space and tracking the progress to their resolution. There is
some Dutch jargon in the documentation and SIA source code, removing it is not
a priority. This document provides some definitions and translations of this
jargon.
