# ZDS 2.0 integration

Early 2019 the VNG (Vereniging van Nederlandse Gemeentenhe / Dutch association
of municipalities) cooperated to implement support for the then, prototype,
Zaak en Document Systeem 2.0. It was shown that ZDS 2.0 could be integrated
with SIA, and that cooperation between Amsterdam and the VNG was possible and
productive.

Since the conclusion of this project both systems have evolved significantly
to the effect that the integration no longer works. In particular, the
integration uses the "zero" version of the SIA API which is no longer
supported, and therefore the implementation was removed from the master
branch of SIA.

Results of collaboration are archived on a protected branch in Github:
